# yon

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mk2/yon.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mk2/yon)

# TBD

- yon will be intended to make multi-cluster tool easily.
- Basically, the language like a factor dialect.
- But it is not intended to expand by itself. So not having the flexibility which was held by some stack-oriented langueages.

```factor
psutil use
math use

:seq (x -- y) ^ 2;
{3 2 1} ["Hello world, %d" writes . ] each
```
